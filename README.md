## Hi there! I'm Jack Davey ðŸ‘‹

### What I work on
I currently work as a software engineer on the SBG DLP team at Cisco.

### Core technologies
Java, Spring boot.

### Useful things to know
I'm severely sight impaired, have Asperger's syndrome, and have a hearing impairment on my left side. Due to my sight impairment, I might not always see messages immediately, but if people message again I normally reply.

### Working hours
My core hours are 7:30 to 3:30, but I often work beyond those hours.
